## Using Refills

1. Install the dependencies:

  - [Install Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon)
  - [Install Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat)
  - [Install Bitters](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bitters)
  - [Install jQuery](http://jquery.com) (if you are using any of the components that require JavaScript)

2. Copy and paste:

  - Go to [refills.bourbon.io](http://refills.bourbon.io) and click the “Show Code” link under the component you want
  - Copy and paste the code into your project
  - The Sass for each component has a set of variables at the very top, which enable quick changes of color, size and general appearance

## Using Refills with Ruby on Rails

We provide a gem for those of you that prefer to add Refills components through Rake tasks instead of copying and pasting.

1. Add Refills to your Gemfile:

  ```ruby
  gem 'refills'
  ```

2. Then run:

  ```bash
  bundle install
  ```

3. Generate components:

  *List all the available components*

  ```bash
  rails generate refills:list
  ```

* `rails generate refills:import SNIPPET` copies:
  * partials to `app/views/refills`
  * stylesheets to `app/assets/stylesheets/refills`
  * javascripts to `app/assets/javascripts/refills`
